# SQL-Challenge

_The purpose of this analysis is to perform a search of all employees from all departments who worked at Pewlett Hackard in the 80s and 90s. Using SQL language, it will be possible to analyze through CSV files and extract data to answer all questions related to employees from that time._

## Data Modeling
_Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBD._

## Data Engineering
_1. Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:_

_* Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints._

_* For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row._

_* Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys._

_2. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table._

## Data Analysis

_1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee._
_2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986._
_3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name._
_4.List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name._
_5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B._
_6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name._
_7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name._
_8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)._

# How to Install and Run the code

_1. Ensure that all the files provided to execute the challenge are inside the folder 'EmployeeSQL'_
_2. The CSV files are located inside the folder 'data'._
_3. Open the programa pgAdmin, create a data base and open query tools to import the data._
_4. Open Schema.sql file located inside the folder 'Resources', select the entire code and press F5 to run it._ 
_5. Then, inside the same folder, open EmployeeAnalysis.sql and run it._   
_6. After run the entire code, verify that all the tables were created successfully._
_7. In onder to get the query results, select each block of code to visualize the data._

# Credits

To complete this challenge, I had tutoring session and also I was able to go over the class with my colleague to better undertand how to create ERDs and using QuickDBD.
